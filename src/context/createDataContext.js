    debugger;
    // the only way to update the state is to dispatch an action to the reducer

    const boundActions = {};
    // loop through the actions
    // call it a dispatch
    // still don't fully get it...
    for (let key in actions) {
      // bind each action to dispatch
      // before: getBlogPosts: Æ’ getBlogPosts(dispatch)
      boundActions[key] = actions[key](dispatch);
      // after: getBlogPosts: function that once executed; will fire dispatch that is bound to the useReducer function
      // YES!! IT MAKES SENSE NOW!
    }

    // all I know is that do this..., and now you have all Crud actions
    // i.e. getBlogPosts
    return (
      <Context.Provider value={{ state, ...boundActions }}>
        {children}
